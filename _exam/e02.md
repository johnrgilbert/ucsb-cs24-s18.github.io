* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam
* No other notes or books are allowed
* There are no makeups for this exam
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper
* We will provide you the table of operator precedence

## Collaborative notes

A fun way to prepare for the exam is to work with your classmates to create notes collaborative. I have created a document with the above list of topics. Jump right in and add content, code examples and other useful information. I will review and comment your notes as will the tutors and TAs! Students who contribute will get star points :)

# Study guide
* Converting procedural code to OOP
* Basic design of classes - member variables and methods. Corrrect declaration of accessors and modifiers and the appropriate use of the const keyword
* Distinguishing between class vs.instance
* Understanding how to create instances of a class on the stack and heap
* Member functions, non-member functions and friend functions - why and how 
* Operator overloading - why and how
* The big 4- Constructor, destructor, copy-constructor, assignment operator (default behavior, overloaded implementation and identifying when each is invoked in any given code)
* Linked-lists - you may be asked to implement any function that involves a linked list
* Recursive implementations involving linked-lists
* The big 4 for linked-lists - why and how to overload the c'tor, de-stor, copy-c'tor and copy assignment
* Run time analysis -- Big-Oh 
* Deriving Big-Oh for code that involves loops
* Binary Search Trees - Implementing all operations and derivations of running times.
* Binary Search Trees - Implementing overloaded operators, and the big 4.
* Analyzing the run times of operations supported by linked lists, sorted arrays ans binary search trees- insert, search, delete, min, max
