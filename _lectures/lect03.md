# Topics

* We examine the differences and similarities between a procedural implementation and a OOP style program by coding up a game involving rolling a pair of die 
* Default and parameterized constructors
* Initializing const member variables using a constructor with an initialization list
* Makefiles: We split our implementation of the die Game into three files  - header file (contains only the class definition), source file (contains the implementation of the class methods - no main), test file - uses the ADT. (More practice on this in lab02)
* Refer to the [gdb cheat sheet](http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf) (handout given in class). More practice in lab 02.
