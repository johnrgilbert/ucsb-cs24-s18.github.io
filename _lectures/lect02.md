# Code from lecture:

# Topics

* Intro to lab01 
* Implementing classes: class vs instance, syntax for classes, scope, methods, instance variables
* We examine the differences and similarities between a procedural implementation and a OOP style program by coding up a game involving rolling a pair of die

* Classes: structs but with methods
* Accessors and modifiers
* When to use classes, how many? The dangers of overobjectification (too many classes)
* ADT (Abstract Data Type) ~ class (w/ info hiding) for use by other programmers

## Github intro
* What is github? How and why we plan to use it in this class
* What is a git repo?
* Creating a github repo and using github's web interface to store your first program

* Gentle intro to github: what is a repo, creating a repo,  cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

* Read the articles on [creating a github repo under an organization](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/), [cloning your first repo](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/) and [git basic workflow](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_basic_workflow/).  We will now put the concepts from all the articles that you have read so far into practice. You may need to refer back to these articles to complete the following steps.
