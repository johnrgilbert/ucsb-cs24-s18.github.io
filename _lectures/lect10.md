# Topics
* Binary trees
* Binary search trees (BST) - implementation
* Operations supported by a BST: Min, Max, Search, insert
* Pre-order, post-order and inorder traversal
* Worst case and average case running time of find on a BST
* BSTs - insert, search, min, max, inorder, preorder and post order traversals
* Running time of BST operations in terms of the height of the tree
* Balanced BSTs
