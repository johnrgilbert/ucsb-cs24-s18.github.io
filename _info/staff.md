  <i> "Hey, my name is Jack, and I’ve been looking forward to TAing this class for the whole year! I’m a master’s student in the Computer Science BS/MS program, where you get a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in five years (highly recommended). In the past, I’ve mentored in CS56 and CS190I, and last quarter I TAed CS184. As I said, I’ve wanted to TA an introductory CS class for quite a while, and I can’t wait to help guide you through the more advanced elements of C++ as well as your first complex data structures. Linked lists and binary search trees had something of a magical quality for me when I first learned them three years ago, and I hope you will have a similarly enthralling experience in this course" </i>

  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m so excited to be one of your tutors for this upcoming quarter! I know this class can be daunting at times, and I’d love to help you with any concept that you might be unclear about, figure out how to approach the PAs, or even give you career or college advice (classes to take, internship advice, things unrelated to academics, etc). <br> This class will set the foundation for your classes in the future so it’s very important to understand the material, and even if you need to ask the same question multiple times to really drive a point home, I never want you to feel afraid to ask me anything! If you see me around campus, feel free to say hi or reach out to me on Piazza. Hope you have a great quarter! :)" </i>

  <b>  Carly  Larsson (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Salutations and welcome to CS 16. In the next nine weeks we will both be learning something new: I will be tutoring CS 16 for the first time, and you all will be taking CS 16. I hope we can work together, and get as much computer science knowledge into our brains as possible. Currently I’m a third year CCS CS student, also enrolled in the MS/BS program. I’m the Treasurer for the Society of Women Engineers (S.W.E) and would love to recruit some new computer scientists! This coming summer and last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. If you have questions about computer science, CS 16, internships, or S.W.E. please reach out to me at carly@umail.ucsb.edu. " </i>

  <b> Natasha Lee (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! I’m Natasha, a fourth year Computer Science major here at UCSB. CS8 was the first time I had ever seen code and programmed a “Hello World” program. I remember feeling like everyone around me was way ahead of me or knew exactly what was going on. But that feeling pushed me work extra hard to catch myself up, allowing me to figure out study habits and tools that worked for my pace of learning.

I love being a tutor/mentor because it’s something I wish I had when I first started learning computer science. There are so many resources available online but sometimes you just don’t know where to start. Us tutors can help guide you and point you in the right direction!

I’ve been told I look intimidating when I’m not talking, but I promise I’m really nice! Come talk to me about cs8, future courses, watercoloring, and most importantly the best spots to watch the sunset!" </i>

  <i> "Hi! My name is  Abhishek, I am a 4th year CCS Computing and Biology double major. I am super excited to be one of the mentors for CS24. Here’s a little background about me:  In the last few years I have been lucky enough to have worked with leading scientists at Stanford, UCSF and UCSB to uncover the potential of big data in computational biology. My interests lie in deep learning precision interpretation of medical imaging for the clinics. I have been involved with a number of ongoing projects in skin and breast cancer quantitative image analysis. If any of you also like these topics or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to contact me on Piazza :) " </i>

  <b>  Andrew Gaut (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Andrew Gaut and I’m a first year computer science major. My pronouns are he/him/his. I’m really excited to tutor CS24 this quarter! I’ve always loved tutoring and I’ve loved computer science since I started, so I’m really excited to merge my two interests! I hope to help learn how to construct readable and usable classes from scratch. I also want to help students understand the concepts behind the projects and labs in CS24, because the concepts are very important (and integral to finishing the programming assignments). Outside of school, I love to watch and play basketball. I’m a HUGE Lakers fan, so I’m always ready to talk about this year’s MVP Lonzo Ball or basketball in general. If any of you guys are interested in software or hardware projects outside of class, I’ve got some experience with the club IEEE and I’ve done one of their projects. If you have any questions about IEEE, want to talk basketball, or have any questions about CS24 feel free to talk to me or email me (at ajg@umail.ucsb.edu)!
